## 5. Manual Test Pattern for Jarvis

To verify Jarvis functionality, follow this test pattern:

1. Start Jarvis and ensure it is listening.
2. Test vision commands: "start vision", "analyze environment", "detect objects", "stop vision".
3. Test system control: "what's the system status", "shutdown system".
4. Test app launching: "open Chrome", "launch Word".
5. Test file management: "organize my downloads".
6. Test typing and running commands: "type hello world", "run command ipconfig".
7. Test news and weather: "what's the latest news", "what's the weather today".
8. Test camera control: "take a photo".
9. Test volume control: "turn volume up", "mute".
10. Test closing apps: "close Chrome".
11. Test keyboard shortcuts: "copy", "undo".
